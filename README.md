# Software Engineer Assessments

This repository contains the different technical assessments. You will need to choose **one** of the assessments to undertake in your technical interview. 

Each assessment makes up part of a mock elections system which could show results pages similar to how [BBC News covers elections](https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2024/uk/results). 

**These pieces of software don't rely on one another or interact in any way.**

## What to do before your interview

* Choose **ONE** assessment you wish to undertake and let your recruitment contact know. Please see guidelines below on choosing one.
* Familiarise yourself with the codebase of your chosen assessment.
* If you are not familiar with how elections work in the UK please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRxUhGetEPQ). 
* Follow the "setup" steps in the Readme of your chosen assessment and get it running locally.
* Ensure you are ready to "screenshare" your working environment during the interview, as per the instructions from our recruitment team.
* **Do not** complete the assessment before the interview

## The applications:

- `election-api-golang` A fake election API written with Go
- `election-api-javascript` A fake election API written with NodeJS
- `election-api-python` A fake elction API written with Python
- `election-ui-javascript` A fake elections Web UI written with React and Javascript

## Choosing an assessment

Things to take into account when choosing your assessment:

* You must choose **ONE** assessment
* If you want a **Frontend or Fullstack** role you must choose the `election-ui-javascript` assessment. 
* Otherwise, choose a language you are most comfortable and that gives you the best opportunity to show your ability. 
* More information on each assessment can be found inside the readme of the relevant application. 

Once you have decided, please let your recruitment contact know.

## Technical Instructions
1. Fork this repo to your local Github account.

## What to expect in your interview

In the assessment we will ask you to screenshare your working environment with us as we discuss and work on the following:

1) How does the software work?
2) Are there any changes/improvements that you would suggest and/or want to tackle?
3) Our elections product team have asked for some new features to be added! With the help of a pair, you will be asked to try to implement one or more of these features.
